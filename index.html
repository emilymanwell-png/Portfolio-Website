                    <h3>Sonifying Healthy and Unhealthy Eosinophil Glycocalyces</h3>
                    <p class="meta">Boise State Vertically Integrated Project | 2025</p>
                    <p>This VIP project explores the intersection of immunology, glycobiology, and music by transforming eosinophil glycocalyx data into structured musical compositions. The project focuses on mapping glycan features—such as monosaccharide composition, linkage type, branching, and modification patterns—onto musical parameters including melody, harmony, rhythm, timbre, and texture. By doing so, the work investigates whether disease-associated changes in eosinophils, particularly in Eosinophilic Esophagitis, produce distinct and perceptible musical signatures.<p>
                    <p>Beyond its artistic dimension, this project serves as a novel framework for data interpretation and science communication. Musical representations may allow listeners to intuitively detect differences between healthy and diseased immune states, offering an alternative modality for understanding complex biological data. The long-term goal is to develop a reproducible, extensible sonification system that bridges molecular-scale biology with human perception, while also contributing to accessibility, interdisciplinary research, and creative scientific outreach.</p>

                    <p class="meta">Boise State BIOL306 Communication in Biology | 2025</p>
                    <p>This project explored how epigenetic data—specifically DNA methylation patterns—can be translated into music to reveal patterns that are difficult to perceive through traditional visual analysis alone. Drawing on primary research literature, I examined methods for encoding methylation states into binary data and mapping those sequences onto musical structures such as pitch, harmony, and rhythm. The project culminated in a written research paper and class presentation analyzing the scientific and communicative potential of biological data sonification. This work served as a conceptual and methodological foundation for my ongoing interdisciplinary research integrating immunology, glycobiology, and music.</p>
